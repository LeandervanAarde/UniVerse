### Login validation and authentication

The login system ensures that only administrators have access to the application. This authentication process safeguards sensitive school management data.

### Dashboard View

The dashboard provides snapshots of essential school data. It presents statistics such as the total number of students, staff members, subjects, and the aggregated student fees. Additionally, the dashboard offers a glimpse of upcoming school events, ensuring that administrators are always informed.

### Students Management Screen

The student management section allows users to efficiently handle student-related tasks. Administrators can browse, and add new students, and navigate to the individual student page to gather insights into individual student data.

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

##### We started off by implementing the frontend of the application. 

* Simon was responsible for implementing the Login page, as well as the Dashboard. 
* Leander was responsible for implementing the staff and staff overview screen, as well as the Students and student overview screen.
* Bronwyn was responsible for for implementing the subjects and subject overview screen, as well as the funds screen.

##### Following that, we moved onto networking and integration

* Simon handled the validation on the Login screen, the nav bar, adding students and staff, and the imlemetation of the modal for the user to change their password apon their first login
* Leander was responsible for researching image uploads, handling the requests for the dashboard on the frontend, implementing charts, handling the login functionality as well as implementing all the functionality in the backend.
* Bronwyn handled the navigation to the overview pages, input capturing, get requests on the frontend for staff, students ans subjects and adding a subject.

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* Our group dynamic worked really well.
* Leander enjoyed handling the backend

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* Image uploads to prostgreSQL
* Adding subjects, staff and students
* Updating information
* Scrollview on the Subject page
* Cross-platform UI
* All group members having access to the database

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* Refinement of the application's UI
* Refinement of the application's adding and editing functionality
* Uploading images to the postgres database
* Color picker
